Kitchen management</h1>
      <p>is an app for orchestrating the various sections of a commercial kitchen, such that orders are displayed, timed and prepared in a 
          logical, sequential manner. The app provides a timeline, which arranges the orders depending on the station(grill, fry), so that each
          chef can, at a glance, determine which item they should be preparing, if there are any modifications to the ingredients and the 
          remaining time before the order should be sent.
